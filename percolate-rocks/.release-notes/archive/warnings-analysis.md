# Warnings Analysis (Historical)

This document tracks compiler warnings during development.

## Current Status (v0.3.0 WIP)

- **Total warnings:** 285
- **Down from:** 286 (removed unused import in sync.rs)
- **Expected:** < 50 after implementation phase complete

## Breakdown

Most warnings are from stub implementations:
- Unused struct fields
- Unused imports
- Dead code in placeholder functions

**These are expected and safe to ignore during active development.**

Once features are implemented, we'll clean up with:
- `#[allow(dead_code)]` for intentionally unused items
- Remove unused imports
- Complete stub implementations

See `status.md` for current implementation status.
