# Actual Implementation Status - Percolate Rocks

## ❌ Current Reality: We Have Nothing Functional

The Rust implementation has **ONLY** the basic storage layer. No actual database features work yet.

### What We Actually Have ✅
- [x] RocksDB storage wrapper
- [x] Entity struct definition
- [x] Schema registry (registration only)
- [x] Basic key encoding
- [x] 3/5 integration tests pass

### What We're Missing (Everything Important) ❌

#### Core Functionality (From Python README)
- [ ] **Embeddings**
  - [ ] Dual embedding support (default + alternative)
  - [ ] Multiple providers (sentence-transformers, OpenAI, Cohere)
  - [ ] Automatic embedding on insert
  - [ ] `fastembed` integration (embedding-anything)
  - [ ] Background worker for async generation

- [ ] **Vector Search**
  - [ ] HNSW index with `hnsw` crate
  - [ ] Cosine similarity
  - [ ] Inner product
  - [ ] Top-k retrieval
  - [ ] Score ranking

- [ ] **SQL Queries**
  - [ ] SQL parser with `sqlparser`
  - [ ] WHERE predicates (=, !=, >, <, IN, AND, OR)
  - [ ] ORDER BY / LIMIT / OFFSET
  - [ ] Field projection
  - [ ] **Vector similarity in SQL**: `WHERE embedding.cosine("query")`
  - [ ] Schema-aware routing

- [ ] **Natural Language Queries**
  - [ ] LLM query builder (convert NL → SQL/vector)
  - [ ] Query type detection
  - [ ] Confidence scoring
  - [ ] Multi-stage retrieval

- [ ] **Graph Queries**
  - [ ] Edge storage
  - [ ] Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
  - [ ] Relationship filtering
  - [ ] Multi-hop queries

- [ ] **Built-in Schemas**
  - [ ] Resources (chunked documents)
  - [ ] Agents (agent-let definitions)
  - [ ] Sessions (conversations)
  - [ ] Messages (chat messages)

## Test Results

```
running 5 tests
test test_database_creation ... ok
test test_schema_validation ... ok
test test_schema_registration ... ok
test test_entity_insert_and_retrieve ... FAILED
test test_entity_scan_by_type ... FAILED

test result: FAILED. 3 passed; 2 failed
```

**Failures:** Bincode serialization issues with `serde_json::Value`

## What Needs to Be Built (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Fix Current Tests (1-2 hours)
1. Fix bincode serialization for entities
2. Get all 5 integration tests passing
3. Add test for entity deletion

### Phase 2: Embeddings (4-6 hours)
1. Integrate `fastembed` crate
2. Add embedding providers (sentence-transformers first)
3. Implement automatic embedding on insert
4. Add dual embedding support (default + alt)
5. Test: Insert entity → embeddings generated

### Phase 3: Vector Search (3-4 hours)
1. Integrate HNSW index (`hnsw` crate)
2. Implement cosine similarity search
3. Add top-k retrieval
4. Persist/load index from disk
5. Test: Vector search returns relevant results

### Phase 4: SQL Queries (6-8 hours)
1. Integrate `sqlparser` crate
2. Parse SELECT/WHERE/ORDER BY/LIMIT
3. Execute predicates on entities
4. Add vector similarity functions in SQL
5. Test: SQL queries work

### Phase 5: Built-in Schemas (2-3 hours)
1. Define Resources, Agents, Sessions, Messages
2. Auto-register on database init
3. Test: Can insert/query built-in entities

### Phase 6: Natural Language (4-6 hours)
1. LLM integration (OpenAI API)
2. Query builder (NL → SQL/vector)
3. Multi-stage retrieval
4. Test: NL query returns results

### Phase 7: Graph Queries (4-6 hours)
1. Edge storage
2. BFS/DFS traversal
3. Relationship filtering
4. Test: Graph queries work

## Estimated Total: ~25-35 hours of actual implementation

## What the Python Version Does (That We Don't)

From `rem-db/README.md`:

```python
from rem_db import REMDatabase

# Create database
db = REMDatabase(tenant_id="acme", path="./data")

# ✅ Insert with automatic embedding
resource_id = db.insert("resources", {
    "name": "Python Tutorial",
    "content": "Learn Python from scratch...",
    "category": "tutorial"
})

# ❌ SQL query (we have NONE of this)
results = db.sql("SELECT * FROM resources WHERE category = 'tutorial'")

# ❌ Vector search (we have NONE of this)
results = db.sql("""
    SELECT name FROM resources
    WHERE embedding.cosine('programming tutorials')
    LIMIT 10
""")

# ❌ Natural language query (we have NONE of this)
result = db.query_natural_language(
    "find tutorials about Python created this month",
    table="resources"
)

# ❌ Graph traversal (we have NONE of this)
edges = db.get_edges(entity_id, direction=Direction.INCOMING)
```

## What We Should Do Next

**Option 1: Port Python Features to Rust (Recommended)**
- Follow the Python implementation as a reference
- Implement embeddings first (most critical)
- Then vector search
- Then SQL queries
- Estimated: 3-4 weeks full-time

**Option 2: Use Python Implementation**
- The Python version already works
- It has all features implemented
- Just needs performance optimization
- Can port to Rust later if needed

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep Python for orchestration
- Use Rust only for performance-critical paths (HNSW index, RocksDB)
- PyO3 bindings for Rust components

## Recommendation

**STOP building infrastructure, START building features.**

The current Rust implementation is 95% scaffolding, 5% functionality. We need:
1. Embeddings working
2. Vector search working
3. SQL queries working
4. Natural language queries working

Everything else is secondary.

Next steps:
1. Fix the 2 failing tests (serialization issue)
2. Implement embeddings with `fastembed`
3. Implement HNSW vector search
4. Write integration tests that match Python examples

Until we have these working, we don't have a database - we have a storage layer.
