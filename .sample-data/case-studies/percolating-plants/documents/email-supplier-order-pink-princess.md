Hi Daan,

Hope you're well! Following up on our conversation last week about the Pink Princess stock.

We're nearly sold out again (only 6 units remaining of PP-3045-SM), and customer demand is showing no signs of slowing. Priya Sharma just picked one up from our Hackney store yesterday, and we have three more customers on our waitlist.

For our February shipment, could we please order:

**Order Details:**
- Product: Philodendron Pink Princess
- Quantity: 12 plants
- Size: 30-40cm height
- Minimum leaves: 4 per plant
- Quality: Your standard (verified Pink Princess, stable variegation)

**Specific Requirements:**
- At least 50% pink variegation across the plant (not necessarily per leaf)
- Clean, pest-free stock with your usual phytosanitary certification
- EU organic certificates included

**Delivery:**
- Preferred delivery: Week of February 19th
- Destination: 127 Regent's Canal Road, Hackney, London E8 4PL
- Our usual 14-day quarantine protocol applies

**Payment:**
- As per our agreement: payment in advance
- I'll initiate bank transfer once you confirm availability
- Our accounting reference: SUP-003-FEB2024

A few questions:

1. Can you do the full 12 plants, or are you limited by propagation success? If you can only do 8-10, that's fine - we'll adjust.

2. What's your variegation like on this batch? Last shipment had some truly spectacular specimens with almost 70% pink coverage. Customers went wild for those!

3. Any chance you have larger specimens (40-50cm)? We've had enquiries for statement pieces, and I'd happily take 2-3 at a premium price point if available.

Also wanted to mention - we had zero losses on the December shipment. Your packaging is excellent, and all twelve plants passed quarantine without issues. Tom has been incredibly impressed with the root health on these specimens.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Hi Elena,

Quick update on propagation progress. I have 15 Pink Princess cuttings that will be ready for your February shipment. Variegation is excellent this round - several showing 60-70% pink.

Can you confirm quantity needed by end of this week? I have other buyers interested but want to prioritize our partnership.

Also - I'm experimenting with a new substrate mix that's improving root development. Excited to get your feedback when they arrive.

Best,
Daan
