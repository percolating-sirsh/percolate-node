Hi Sophie,

Thanks for reaching out, and don't worry - yellow leaves on a Monstera are usually an easy fix!

I've looked up your order (you purchased PP-1001-SM from our Hackney store on January 15th), and based on your photos, I can see you've got a beautiful, healthy plant overall. The yellowing on the lower two leaves is most likely a watering issue.

**Here's what I think is happening:**

Your Monstera is showing classic signs of overwatering. The yellow leaves with slight browning at the edges, plus the fact that the soil looks quite dark and moist in your photo, suggests the roots are staying too wet between waterings.

**Quick fixes:**

1. **Check the soil moisture**: Stick your finger 5cm (about two knuckles deep) into the soil. It should feel mostly dry before you water again. For a plant this size in winter, that's probably every 10-14 days.

2. **Drainage check**: Is there a drainage hole in that decorative pot? If not, the plant is sitting in water at the bottom. Either:
   - Keep it in the nursery pot (the plastic one it came in) and just set that inside the decorative pot, OR
   - Drill a drainage hole in the decorative pot

3. **Remove the yellow leaves**: Once a leaf has turned yellow, it won't recover. Trim them off at the base with clean scissors. This helps the plant focus energy on healthy growth.

4. **Adjust your routine**: London's been quite grey this February, so the plant is using less water than it would in summer. Cut back watering frequency until we get more daylight hours (March/April).

**Going forward:**

- Water only when top 5cm of soil is dry (use the finger test!)
- Make sure water drains freely from the bottom
- Monstera would rather be too dry than too wet
- Consider our Organic Plant Food (PP-5008-AC - ¬£12.50) when spring arrives to boost growth

I've attached our Monstera care guide PDF (prepared by Tom, our senior horticulturist). It covers seasonal watering adjustments, which is super helpful for London's variable weather.

**Your plant will be fine!** The main stem and new growth look perfect. Just adjust the watering, remove those yellow leaves, and you'll see improvement within a couple of weeks.

If you have any other questions, just reply to this email or pop into the Hackney store - I'm usually there Wednesdays and Fridays, and I'd love to see how your plant is doing!

Best wishes,

**Charlotte Mills**

**Subject**: Help! My Monstera has yellow leaves

Hi,

I bought a Monstera from your Hackney store last month and it was doing great, but now two of the leaves have turned yellow! I'm worried I'm killing it.

I've been watering it every few days because I heard they like humidity. It's in my living room which gets pretty good light from the window.

I've attached photos. Can you help?

Thanks,
Sophie
