## Sourcing Information

**Contact**: Takeshi Nakamura
**Origin**: Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire
**Certification**: Japanese Maple Society member

Sourced from Takeshi Nakamura's specialist nursery in Oxfordshire, these maples are grafted specimens from authentic Japanese rootstock. Takeshi's family has been growing Japanese maples for three generations, and his attention to form and structure is exceptional.

Each tree is:
- Minimum 4 years old from grafting
- Professionally shaped with clean branching structure
- Hardened off for UK climate conditions
- Certified disease-free (no tar spot or verticillium wilt)

## Seasonal Interest

**Spring**: Fresh lime-green to bronze-red leaves emerge (variety dependent)
**Summer**: Deep burgundy-red foliage provides rich color contrast
**Autumn**: Spectacular crimson-red fall color (October-November)
**Winter**: Elegant branching structure revealed, attractive bark

## Care Requirements

**Difficulty**: Moderate - requires positioning consideration
**Light**: Partial shade to dappled sunlight (protect from harsh afternoon sun and strong winds)
**Water**: Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged (mulch helps retain moisture)
**Soil**: Well-drained, slightly acidic soil (pH 5.5-6.5)
**Feeding**: Apply ericaceous fertilizer in spring; our Organic Plant Food (PP-5008-AC) diluted 50%
**Pruning**: Minimal - only prune in late summer to early autumn (never in spring due to bleeding sap)

## Planting Guidelines

**Container Growing**:
- Use ericaceous compost with added grit for drainage
- Repot every 3-4 years in early spring
- Protect pot from freezing in severe winters (wrap or move to sheltered location)

**Garden Planting**:
- Dig hole twice width of root ball, same depth
- Improve heavy soil with compost and horticultural grit
- Mulch around base (keeping clear of trunk)
- Stake for first two years if exposed site

## Position & Companion Planting

**Ideal Locations**:
- Woodland-style gardens
- Japanese or zen gardens
- Patio containers (use large, frost-proof pot)
- Front gardens as specimen tree
- Courtyards and sheltered urban spaces

**Companion Plants**:
- Hostas for contrasting foliage
- Ferns for woodland aesthetic
- Lavender (PP-4001-MD) for Mediterranean contrast
- Japanese forest grasses for textural interest

## Features

- Multi-season ornamental value
- Refined, architectural form
- Ideal for small to medium gardens (mature size manageable)
- Low maintenance once established
- Suitable for containers or open ground
- Attracts wildlife (provides shelter for birds)

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Leaf scorch (brown, crispy edges)**: Too much sun or wind - relocate to more sheltered position
**Pale leaves**: Soil too alkaline - add ericaceous compost and feed with iron-rich fertilizer
**Sparse growth**: Insufficient water during growing season
**Frost damage on new growth**: Late spring frost - cover with horticultural fleece if frost forecast

## Special Care Notes

- **Wind protection essential**: Delicate leaves easily damaged by strong winds
- **Spring frost awareness**: Young leaves vulnerable to late frosts (April-May in London)
- **Avoid pruning in spring**: Maples "bleed" sap profusely if pruned during sap rise
- **Container specimens**: Require more frequent watering than ground-planted trees
