**Pot Size**: 14cm diameter
**Pot Type**: Premium ceramic (included in price)
**Mature Size**: 60-90cm indoors with support
**Growth Rate**: Slow to moderate (15-30cm per year)

## Sourcing Information

**Supplier**: Rare Botanicals Europe (SUP-003)
**Contact**: Daan van Bergen
**Origin**: Amsterdam, Netherlands
**Certification**: EU Organic certified

This exclusive variety comes from Daan van Bergen's specialist greenhouse in Amsterdam. Each plant is propagated from verified Pink Princess stock, not the similar-looking but cheaper 'Pink Congo' which loses its color over time. Daan's operation is one of the few in Europe producing genuine, stable Pink Princess specimens.

**Import Note**: All specimens arrive with EU phytosanitary certificates and are quarantined for 14 days upon arrival to ensure health.

## Care Requirements

**Difficulty**: Moderate to Challenging - for experienced plant owners
**Light**: Bright indirect light (essential for maintaining pink variegation)
**Water**: Water when top 3cm of soil is dry - avoid both overwatering and complete drying
**Humidity**: 60-70% minimum (use humidifier or pebble tray)
**Temperature**: 18-24°C (very sensitive to temperature fluctuations)
**Feeding**: Every 2-3 weeks during growing season with diluted Organic Plant Food (PP-5008-AC)

## Special Care Notes

**Variegation Management**:
- Pink sections contain no chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesize
- Balance is key: too much pink and plant struggles, too much green and aesthetic suffers
- If predominantly green leaves appear, increase light slightly
- All-pink leaves should be removed as they weaken the plant

**Propagation**: Can be propagated from stem cuttings (node must include both pink and green for viable growth)

## Features

- Rare pink and green variegation (each leaf is unique)
- Heart-shaped leaves with glossy finish
- Climbing growth habit
- Highly sought-after by collectors
- Instagram-worthy aesthetic

## What's Included

- Established Philodendron Pink Princess plant (minimum 4 leaves)
- Premium glazed ceramic pot (white or blush pink - specify at checkout)
- Care guide written by Elena Vasquez (EMP-001), our Head of Horticulturist
- Lifetime email support from our horticulture team

## Authentication

Due to market confusion with similar-looking varieties, each Pink Princess includes:
- Photo documentation of parent plant
- Supplier certificate from Rare Botanicals Europe (SUP-003)
- Percolating Plants guarantee of authenticity

## Common Issues & Solutions

**Losing pink color**: Insufficient light - move to brighter location (but not direct sun)
**Browning pink sections**: Over-fertilizing - reduce feeding frequency
**Slow growth**: Normal for this variety, especially in winter months
**All-green reversion**: Some reversion is normal; prune back to variegated growth

## Customer Notes

This is a premium, limited-stock item. Due to the rarity and specific care requirements, we recommend:

1. **Experience level**: You've successfully kept other Philodendrons or similarly demanding plants
2. **Light availability**: You have a suitable bright, indirect light location
3. **Commitment**: You're prepared for attentive care (this is not a "set and forget" plant)

For customers new to variegated plants, we recommend starting with our Monstera Deliciosa (PP-1001-SM) or Calathea Orbifolia (PP-3021-MD).
