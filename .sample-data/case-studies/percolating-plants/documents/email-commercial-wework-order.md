## Notes & Recommendations

**Plant Selection Rationale**:
- **Snake Plants** (PP-2015-SM): Extremely low-maintenance, tolerates low light and irregular watering. Perfect for meeting rooms and individual desks. Our most reliable performer in office environments.

- **Monstera** (PP-1001-SM): Statement pieces with proven track record in your space. These were your most successful plants from our October installation. The architectural leaves add visual interest without demanding care.

- **Fiddle Leaf Fig** (PP-1002-LG): Reception and high-traffic areas only. Needs brighter light but creates strong visual impact. We'll position these strategically near windows.

- **Calathea Orbifolia** (PP-3021-MD): For collaborative spaces where you want something special. Requires more attention but your facilities team has shown excellent plant care skills. These will be conversation starters!

**Sourcing Note**:
All plants will be sourced from our trusted UK suppliers:
- Snake Plants & Monstera: Greenfield Nurseries (SUP-001), Kent
- Fiddle Leaf Fig: Heritage Plants & Trees (SUP-002), Devon
- Calathea: Tropical House Growers (SUP-005), Cornwall

**Sustainability**:
- All packaging will be collected and recycled
- Old plants rehomed through our charity partner (Urban Growth Foundation)
- Organic, peat-free growing medium
- FSC-certified decorative pebbles

## Previous Performance

- 18 orders since February 2021
