## Transcript

**Marcus Chen** [00:00:12]
Right, let's get started. Thanks everyone for making time. We're here to review our supplier performance for Q4 2023 and set priorities for Q1 2024. Elena, you want to kick us off?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:00:28]
Sure. Overall, I'm really pleased with our supplier relationships. We've maintained our 70% UK sourcing target, and quality has been consistently high. Let me go through them one by one.

Starting with Greenfield Nurseries - that's SUP-001, Sarah's operation in Maidstone. They supply our Monstera Deliciosa, product code PP-1001-SM, and the Snake Plants, PP-2015-SM.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:01:02]
Sarah's been brilliant. The Monstera stock from last month was exceptional - really strong root systems, healthy foliage. We had maybe 2% that didn't meet our standards, which is well below industry average.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:01:18]
Agreed. And she's been flexible on delivery scheduling. When we had that rush order for WeWork - that's customer CUST-2002 - she turned around 15 Snake Plants in 48 hours. That's relationship capital you can't buy.

**Aisha Patel** [00:01:35]
From an operations perspective, Greenfield is one of our smoothest suppliers. Weekly deliveries, reusable crate system means minimal packaging waste, invoicing is clean. No issues there.

**Marcus Chen** [00:01:48]
What about pricing? Are we still competitive?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:01:52]
Her pricing has held steady. We're paying about 20% more than if we imported from Dutch megafarms, but the quality difference justifies it. Plus, the sustainability angle - local sourcing, peat-free, organic certification. That's our brand.

**Marcus Chen** [00:02:10]
Okay, continue this relationship. Next?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:02:14]
Heritage Plants & Trees, SUP-002, Tom Hartley in Exeter. He supplies our Fiddle Leaf Figs, PP-1002-LG.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:02:24]
Tom's plants are beautiful, but we've had some logistics challenges. The Devon to London transport can be rough on the plants, especially in winter. We've had a few arrive with cold damage.

**Luis Rodriguez** [00:02:38]
I've been working with their courier. The issue is they're using a general freight service, not a specialist plant courier. I've suggested switching to the same service we use for our customer deliveries, but it's more expensive.

**Aisha Patel** [00:02:54]
How much more?

**Luis Rodriguez** [00:02:56]
About 35% increase in their shipping costs. Which either they absorb or pass to us.

**Marcus Chen** [00:03:03]
What's our damage rate?

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:03:06]
December and January, we had about 8% arrive with issues. That's high. I'm spending time rehabilitating them, which is labor cost we're not accounting for.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:03:18]
I'll talk to Tom Hartley. The plants themselves are excellent quality - it's purely a transport issue. Maybe we can negotiate shared shipping costs if he switches courier. We're one of his bigger customers.

**Marcus Chen** [00:03:32]
Good. Make that happen. Next?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:03:35]
Rare Botanicals Europe, SUP-003. Daan van Bergen in Amsterdam. This is our Pink Princess Philodendron source, PP-3045-SM.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:03:45]
[laughs] Daan's plants are works of art. Genuinely. The variegation quality is exceptional.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:03:52]
Daan's great. His operation is small - he can only supply 10-15 plants every 8-10 weeks because he propagates everything himself. But every single plant arrives perfect. Zero losses in our December shipment.

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:08]
His phytosanitary paperwork is immaculate too. Post-Brexit import requirements can be a nightmare, but Daan has it sorted. Every shipment comes with complete EU organic certification, plant passports, the works.

**Marcus Chen** [00:04:22]
What's our sell-through rate on the Pink Princess?

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:25]
Fast. We're down to 6 units from the December shipment. I've got three people on the waitlist already.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:04:32]
I emailed Daan last week actually. He's got 15 ready for mid-February. I'm requesting all 15 if we can afford the upfront payment.

**Marcus Chen** [00:04:42]
At £125 retail, definitely. What's our cost?

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:45]
We're paying Daan about £68 per plant, plus shipping works out to about £75 all-in.

**Marcus Chen** [00:04:52]
So healthy margin. Yeah, take all 15. This is exactly the kind of specialty product that differentiates us.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:05:01]
I also wanted to mention - Priya Sharma, one of our regular customers, CUST-1005, bought one of Daan's plants last month and left a glowing review. She specifically mentioned the authentication certificate we include. That's become a selling point.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:05:18]
There's so many fake Pink Princess or that Pink Congo variety that reverts. Being able to guarantee authenticity with Daan's documentation - that's worth the premium price.

**Marcus Chen** [00:05:29]
Agreed. Continue and expand if possible. What else?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:05:34]
Let me touch on Tropical House Growers, SUP-005, Peter Cardinale in Cornwall. He supplies our Calathea Orbifolia, PP-3021-MD.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:05:46]
Peter's fascinating. He's using surplus heat from the Eden Project to maintain his tropical greenhouse temperatures. The plants are stunning.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:05:56]
Quality is excellent, but his capacity is limited. He's a small operation. We get maybe 20-30 plants per month, and he has other customers.

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:06]
We sold 12 Calathea in January alone. We could sell more if we had stock.

**Marcus Chen** [00:06:12]
Should we look for a second supplier for this variety?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:06:16]
Potentially, but I'm hesitant. Peter's growing method - the Eden Project partnership, the sustainable heat source - that's a great story. And his plants really are exceptional quality.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:06:29]
What if we position it as a specialty, limited availability item? Like we do with the Pink Princess. Make scarcity part of the appeal.

**Marcus Chen** [00:06:38]
I like that. Premium positioning, limited stock. Aisha, can you draft some marketing copy around that?

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:44]
Yeah, definitely. "Sustainably grown in Cornwall using Eden Project's renewable heat" - that's compelling.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:06:52]
One more I want to highlight - Shipton Japanese Gardens, SUP-007, Takeshi Nakamura in Henley-on-Thames. Our Japanese Maples, PP-4012-LG.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:07:04]
Takeshi is an artist. The way he shapes those maples - it's traditional Japanese technique. Every tree is a specimen.

**Elena Vasquez** [00:07:14]
We're stocking 8 units currently at £145 each. They're slow-moving compared to houseplants, but the margins are good and they attract a different customer segment.

**Aisha Patel** [00:07:26]
Emma Lawson - CUST-1003 - bought one for her Richmond garden last month and referred two friends. And Berkeley Homes, CUST-2004, ordered three for their latest show home. These are relationship builders with high-value customers.

**Marcus Chen** [00:07:42]
How's Takeshi to work with?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:07:44]
Lovely. Very professional. He's selective about retailers - he wants to make sure his trees go to people who'll care for them properly. Tom actually had to send him photos of our shop setup before he'd agree to supply us initially.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:07:59]
[laughs] True. He interviewed me about our horticultural knowledge. I respected that.

**Marcus Chen** [00:08:05]
Okay, continue that relationship. What about our packaging supplier? That's EcoPackaging, SUP-010, right?

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:14]
Yeah, Lucy Martinez's operation in Bristol. They've been great. The plastic-free packaging system we designed with them is working well. It costs us 40% more than conventional packaging, but customer feedback has been really positive.

**Luis Rodriguez** [00:08:30]
From a logistics perspective, it's been smooth. The packaging protects plants well during shipping. I was worried the paper-based system wouldn't hold up, but we've had very few damage claims.

**Marcus Chen** [00:08:43]
Damage rate compared to when we used plastic wrap?

**Luis Rodriguez** [00:08:46]
Actually slightly lower. The paper system seems to provide better cushioning. Our damage claims dropped from about 3.5% to 2.8%.

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:56]
Plus it's a marketing angle. Every delivery includes a card explaining our plastic-free commitment. We're seeing that mentioned in customer reviews and social media.

**Marcus Chen** [00:09:07]
Great. That's exactly the kind of value alignment we want. Any issues we need to address?

**Aisha Patel** [00:09:13]
Lucy's mentioned her prices might increase 10-15% in Q2 due to raw material costs. I'll negotiate, but we should budget for some increase.

**Marcus Chen** [00:09:24]
Okay, keep me posted. Anything else on suppliers?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:09:28]
Just to mention - we're at 72% UK sourcing for Q4, above our 70% target. The only imports are Daan's Pink Princess from Netherlands. Everything else is domestic.

**Marcus Chen** [00:09:42]
That's fantastic. Well done team. From a brand perspective, that's exactly where we need to be, especially with our B Corp application.

**Tom Bradshaw** [00:09:52]
Are we looking to add any new suppliers this quarter?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:09:56]
I'm exploring a couple. There's a specialist orchid grower in Hampshire I've been talking to. And I'd like to find a UK source for pothos - we keep getting customer requests and we don't currently stock them.

**Marcus Chen** [00:10:10]
What about Heritage Plants - SUP-002 - couldn't they do pothos?

**Elena Vasquez** [00:10:15]
Possibly. That's Tom Hartley in Devon. I'll ask. Might be a good way to diversify our ordering with them, especially if we're asking them to upgrade their shipping.

**Aisha Patel** [00:10:26]
We had someone in the Hackney store last week asking for pothos specifically. Said they'd seen it on Instagram. There's definitely demand.

**Marcus Chen** [00:10:35]
Okay, Elena, explore that and report back. Anything else?

**Luis Rodriguez** [00:10:40]
Quick logistics note - our delivery partnership with DPD Green is working well. Carbon-neutral shipping is a selling point, and their plant handling training has been good. Recommend we continue.

**Marcus Chen** [00:10:52]
Agreed. Alright, let's wrap up. Summary: Continue relationships with Greenfield, Rare Botanicals, Tropical House, Shipton, and EcoPackaging. Elena to address Heritage Plants shipping issues. Take all 15 Pink Princess from Daan's February batch. Explore pothos sourcing. Anything I missed?

**Aisha Patel** [00:11:12]
Nope, that covers it.

**Marcus Chen** [00:11:14]
Great meeting, everyone. Thanks.
