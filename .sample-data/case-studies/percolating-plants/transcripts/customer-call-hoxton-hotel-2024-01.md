## Transcript

**Aisha Patel** [00:00:03]
Good afternoon, Percolating Plants, Aisha speaking. How can I help?

**James Barrett** [00:00:07]
Hi Aisha, it's James Barrett from The Hoxton in Shoreditch. How are you?

**Aisha Patel** [00:00:11]
James! I'm well, thanks. Good to hear from you. What can I do for you today?

**James Barrett** [00:00:16]
So, we're really happy with the plants you installed back in October for our lobby refresh. They're looking great. Our guests comment on them regularly.

**Aisha Patel** [00:00:26]
That's wonderful to hear! That was, let me check... yes, that was 12 Monstera and 8 Snake Plants, primarily in the ground floor reception and bar areas, right?

**James Barrett** [00:00:38]
Exactly, yes. Product codes PP-1001-SM for the Monstera and PP-2015-SM for the Snake Plants, if I'm reading my invoice correctly.

**Aisha Patel** [00:00:47]
[laughs] You're reading it correctly! I'm impressed you've got the product codes memorized.

**James Barrett** [00:00:52]
[laughs] I've been looking at them a lot actually, which brings me to why I'm calling. We're opening a new Hoxton location in Southwark in May, and I wanted to explore two things: plants for the new site, and possibly some kind of maintenance contract for both locations.

**Aisha Patel** [00:01:10]
Okay, great! Let me grab my notebook. So, Southwark opening in May - congratulations on the expansion. What's the timeline you're working with?

**James Barrett** [00:01:20]
Soft opening is May 15th, but we'd want plants installed by May 1st to let them settle in before we're fully operational. The property is similar size to our Shoreditch location - about 200 rooms, large ground-floor public areas, restaurant, bar.

**Aisha Patel** [00:01:38]
Perfect. And you mentioned a maintenance contract?

**James Barrett** [00:01:42]
Yes. So, our current approach is our facilities team waters the plants - we've been following the care instructions your team provided, and honestly it's been fine. But we're stretched thin, and with a second location coming online, I'm wondering if you offer any kind of regular maintenance service.

**Aisha Patel** [00:02:02]
We do, actually. We've been piloting maintenance contracts with a few commercial clients over the past six months. Let me explain how it works, and you can tell me if it fits your needs.

**James Barrett** [00:02:13]
Perfect.

**Aisha Patel** [00:02:14]
So, we offer weekly or fortnightly site visits. One of our team - usually Tom, our senior horticulturist, or one of our trained retail staff - comes to your site, assesses each plant, waters as needed, checks for pests or disease, removes dead foliage, that kind of thing. It's preventative maintenance to keep everything looking pristine.

**James Barrett** [00:02:38]
Weekly or fortnightly - what would you recommend for a hotel environment?

**Aisha Patel** [00:02:43]
For The Hoxton, probably fortnightly would be sufficient. The species we installed are quite low-maintenance - the Monstera and Snake Plants are tough. They don't need frequent intervention. Weekly would be more for higher-maintenance tropical species or if you had a large installation with varied species.

**James Barrett** [00:03:02]
Okay, fortnightly makes sense. What's the cost look like?

**Aisha Patel** [00:03:06]
We charge based on plant count and travel time. For your Shoreditch location - 20 plants, central London location - we'd be looking at about £150 per visit, so £300 per month on a fortnightly schedule.

**James Barrett** [00:03:22]
And that covers everything? Watering, maintenance, health checks?

**Aisha Patel** [00:03:27]
Yes, all routine maintenance. If a plant needs to be replaced - which should be rare if we're maintaining them regularly - that would be charged separately, but we'd give you a heads up first. Think of it as preventative care rather than emergency intervention.

**James Barrett** [00:03:43]
Makes sense. And if we did both locations - Shoreditch and the new Southwark site?

**Aisha Patel** [00:03:49]
We could do a combined contract. Southwark - similar size to Shoreditch, similar plant count - would also be £150 per visit. If we service both locations on the same day, we could discount the travel time a bit. Maybe £280 per visit total for both sites instead of £300. That's £560 per month.

**James Barrett** [00:04:12]
That's reasonable. And who would be doing the visits?

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:16]
Primarily Tom Bradshaw - he's our senior horticulturist, employee ID EMP-004. He's been with us since 2019, RHS Level 3 qualified, really knows his stuff. You might have met him during the October installation?

**James Barrett** [00:04:31]
Tall guy, very knowledgeable, spent like 20 minutes explaining Monstera care to our bar manager?

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:36]
[laughs] That's Tom, yes. He's passionate about plant education. Sometimes too passionate - I have to remind him we bill by the hour.

**James Barrett** [00:04:44]
[laughs] No, that was great actually. Our bar manager, Sarah, really appreciated it. She's been the one caring for the plants, and she's done a good job based on Tom's advice.

**Aisha Patel** [00:04:55]
Excellent. Tom would be your primary contact, though occasionally it might be one of our retail managers if Tom's off sick or on holiday. But it would always be someone qualified.

**James Barrett** [00:05:06]
Okay, I'm definitely interested in the maintenance contract. Let's put a pin in that and circle back. What about the new Southwark installation? What's the process there?

**Aisha Patel** [00:05:17]
First step would be a site visit. Elena - she's our co-founder and head of horticulture, EMP-001 - or Tom would come to the Southwark property, assess the light levels, space, aesthetic you're going for. From there, we'd propose a plant selection and quote.

**James Barrett** [00:05:34]
Could we just replicate what we did in Shoreditch? We're happy with those plants.

**Aisha Patel** [00:05:39]
Absolutely, if the space is similar and the light conditions work. The beauty of Monstera and Snake Plants is they're versatile. But we'd still recommend a quick site visit just to confirm. Different buildings have different light, different heating systems, different air quality. Ten years doing this, we've learned not to assume.

**James Barrett** [00:05:59]
Fair enough. When could you do a site visit?

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:03]
Let me check our calendar... How's the week of January 29th? Tom could do either Wednesday the 31st or Thursday February 1st?

**James Barrett** [00:06:15]
Let me check... Thursday February 1st works better. Morning if possible?

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:21]
10am?

**James Barrett** [00:06:22]
Perfect. I'll send you the address. It's near Borough Market.

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:27]
Great location. Okay, so I've got Tom Bradshaw scheduled for site visit, Thursday February 1st, 10am, Southwark property. Can you email me the address and any access instructions?

**James Barrett** [00:06:40]
Will do. I'll send that right after this call.

**Aisha Patel** [00:06:44]
Brilliant. After the site visit, Tom will put together a proposal - plant selection, quantities, containers, installation timeline. We'll get that to you within a week of the visit. May 1st installation date gives us plenty of time.

**James Barrett** [00:07:00]
Excellent. Now, going back to the maintenance contract - if we went ahead with that, when could you start?

**Aisha Patel** [00:07:08]
For the existing Shoreditch location, we could start basically immediately. First visit could be as early as next week if you wanted. For Southwark, obviously that would start after installation, so post-May 1st.

**James Barrett** [00:07:23]
What if we trial it? Start with Shoreditch, see how it goes, then add Southwark when it opens?

**Aisha Patel** [00:07:31]
Absolutely. We don't require long-term contracts. We typically do month-to-month for the first three months, then if everyone's happy, we move to quarterly contracts with a small discount.

**James Barrett** [00:07:44]
What's the discount for quarterly?

**Aisha Patel** [00:07:46]
About 10%. So instead of £300 per month for Shoreditch, you'd pay £270. Adds up over time.

**James Barrett** [00:07:54]
Okay. Let's do this: Start the maintenance contract for Shoreditch immediately, month-to-month. After we see how that goes and after the Southwark installation, we'll discuss expanding to a full two-site quarterly contract.

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:09]
Perfect. That's very sensible. I'll draw up a maintenance agreement for the Shoreditch location. First visit - let me suggest Tuesday January 30th? That gives us time to get paperwork sorted, and Tom can do his initial assessment.

**James Barrett** [00:08:26]
That works. What time?

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:28]
What's least disruptive for you? We're flexible.

**James Barrett** [00:08:32]
Mid-morning is good, like 10 or 11am. Reception is quieter then.

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:38]
Let's say 10:30am. Tom will be there, he'll spend about 45 minutes on that first visit because he'll be establishing a baseline for each plant. Subsequent visits will be quicker, probably 30 minutes.

**James Barrett** [00:08:52]
Perfect. And invoicing?

**Aisha Patel** [00:08:54]
We invoice monthly, sent first week of the month for the previous month's services. Your account is set up for net 30 payment terms, which will continue.

**James Barrett** [00:09:05]
Great, that matches our AP cycle. Okay, I think that covers everything. So to summarize: Maintenance contract starting for Shoreditch, first visit January 30th at 10:30am. Site visit for Southwark on February 1st at 10am, with proposal to follow.

**Aisha Patel** [00:09:24]
Exactly. I'll send you two emails: one confirming the maintenance contract with terms and pricing, and one confirming Tom's site visit at Southwark. Both today.

**James Barrett** [00:09:35]
Brilliant. Actually, one more question - the plants you installed in October, where did they come from? We've had a few guests ask.

**Aisha Patel** [00:09:45]
Great question! The Monstera - that's PP-1001-SM - comes from Greenfield Nurseries, SUP-001, Sarah Greenfield's operation in Maidstone, Kent. The Snake Plants, PP-2015-SM, also from Greenfield. All UK-grown, organic certified, peat-free.

**James Barrett** [00:10:04]
That's fantastic. We have a sustainability report we publish annually, and being able to say our plants are locally sourced and organic fits perfectly with our values.

**Aisha Patel** [00:10:15]
Actually, if you want, I can provide you with supplier information for your sustainability report. We're very transparent about our supply chain. It's part of our B Corp application process.

**James Barrett** [00:10:27]
Oh, you're going for B Corp? We achieved that last year. It's a rigorous process but worth it.

**Aisha Patel** [00:10:33]
Any advice?

**James Barrett** [00:10:34]
[laughs] Get your documentation organized early. They want evidence for everything. But sounds like you're already tracking your supply chain, which is half the battle.

**Aisha Patel** [00:10:44]
Good to know. Thanks! Alright, is there anything else I can help with today?

**James Barrett** [00:10:50]
No, I think we're all set. Thanks, Aisha. Really appreciate how straightforward you make this.

**Aisha Patel** [00:10:56]
It's a pleasure working with you, James. You're one of our favorite clients - organized, pays on time, takes care of the plants. Makes our lives easy.

**James Barrett** [00:11:05]
[laughs] We try! Alright, I'll watch for those confirmation emails.

**Aisha Patel** [00:11:09]
They'll be in your inbox within the hour. Have a great rest of your day!

**James Barrett** [00:11:14]
You too, thanks. Bye.

**Aisha Patel** [00:11:16]
Bye!
